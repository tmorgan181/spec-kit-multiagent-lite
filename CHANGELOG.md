## [0.3.2] - 2025-10-12

**Patch Release: Usability & Validation Improvements**

Bug fixes and UX improvements discovered during v0.3.1 testing and usage.

### Added

**Shell Aliases:**
- Added common shell shortcuts: `ps`/`pwsh` â†’ `powershell`, `sh` â†’ `bash`
- Example: `lite-kits add --shell ps` now works

**Better Error Messages:**
- Agent/shell errors now show valid options and aliases
- Example: `Unknown shell: 'cmd'` â†’ shows "Valid options: bash, powershell" + aliases

### Fixed

**Validation Logic:**
- Agent-specific validation now only checks files for agents that have kit files installed
- Fixed false negatives when dev-kit installed for Copilot but not Claude
- Example: Having `.claude/` (spec-kit only) + `.github/prompts/` (spec-kit + dev-kit) now validates correctly

**CLI UX:**
- Removed extra trailing newlines from `--version` output (cleaner display)
- Preview header only shows after validation passes (not before error messages)

### Changed

**Code Quality:**
- Moved preview header display into `_display_changes` for DRY (single source of truth)
- Improved error handling for invalid agent/shell values

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-11

**Patch Release: Post-Release Cleanup & Workflow Protection**

Quick patch release to clean up repository structure and add workflow enforcement after v0.3.0 release.

### Added

**Workflow Protection:**
- GitHub Actions workflow to enforce developâ†’main PR workflow
- Prevents accidental PRs from feature branches directly to main
- Only allows PRs from `develop` branch to `main`
- Clear error messages with correct workflow guidance

### Changed

**Repository Cleanup:**
- Removed `specs/` directory from repository (now gitignored for local use)
- Updated `.gitignore` to allow `.github/workflows/` while ignoring other `.github` contents
- Cleaned up 7 merged branches (4 remote + 3 local) from v0.3.0 work

### Fixed

**Git Workflow:**
- Added programmatic protection against incorrect branching patterns
- Enforces feature â†’ develop â†’ main workflow at CI level
- Prevents future "oops branched from main" mistakes

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-10

**Polish Release: PyPI Launch Preparation**

This release focuses on user experience polish and documentation improvements in preparation for the first public PyPI release.

### Added

**UX Improvements:**
- Kit name headers in preview output (easier to see what each kit installs)
- Empty directory cleanup after kit removal (cleaner uninstall experience)
- Comprehensive installation flow in README (step-by-step from spec-kit to first command)
- AI assistant compatibility section in README (clarifies GitHub Copilot + Claude Code support)

**Documentation:**
- Project constitution (v1.0.0) - Core principles and development standards
- Dependency audit report - Validates sparkling dependency story for PyPI
- Enhanced README prerequisites with links to all dependencies
- Clarified spec-kit as REQUIRED dependency (not optional)

### Changed

**Error Messages:**

- Updated orient command detection logic (removed redundant checks)
- Consistent kit naming across 26 files

### Fixed

**Critical:**
- Command audit found and fixed 26 files with outdated kit names
- Orient command now correctly detects "dev" kit instead of "project, git"
- All cross-command references verified for accuracy

**Documentation:**
- README installation flow now shows complete dependency chain
- Prerequisites section clarifies Node.js requirement (for spec-kit)
- AI assistant compatibility explained (works with multiple agents)

### Documentation

**Updated:**
- README.md - Complete installation flow overhaul
- CHANGELOG.md - This release!
- .specify/memory/constitution.md - Project principles and standards

**New:**
- docs/validation/v0.3.0-dependency-audit.md - Dependency analysis
- docs/validation/v0.3.0-command-audit.md - Complete command audit report
- docs/wip/wishlist-prioritized.md - Feature roadmap for v0.4+

### Technical Improvements

**Code Quality (Last-Minute Polish):**
- Extracted constants to `__init__.py` for single source of truth
  - Version, app name, kit names, directory paths, error messages
  - Reduced code duplication across cli.py and installer.py
  - All version/identifier references now use constants
- Command audit performed on all 16 command files (8 commands Ã— 2 agents)
  - Verified bash and PowerShell versions match logically
  - Fixed sync.prompt.md having bash syntax instead of PowerShell
  - All cross-command references verified for accuracy

**Bug Fixes (Last-Minute):**
- Agent detection now works when only parent directory exists (e.g., `.github/` without `.github/prompts/`)
  - Copilot detection was failing if `.github/prompts/` didn't exist yet
  - Now detects `.github/` and creates subdirectory on install
  - More flexible detection that doesn't require full path structure upfront

**Planning for v0.4:**
- Updated wishlist with DRY command templating (ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ priority)
  - Eliminate duplicate .claude + .github files (16 â†’ 8 templates)
  - Single source of truth with shell/agent interpolation
- Added prompt optimization + script standardization
  - Reduce tool call count (Claude makes 5-10 calls for simple git ops)
  - Helper scripts for repeatable multi-step tasks

### Release Notes

This polish release makes lite-kits PyPI-ready with improved error messages, clearer documentation, and verified command accuracy. All user-facing text has been audited for consistency and clarity.

**Key improvements for new users:**
- Installation flow is crystal clear (prerequisites â†’ install â†’ use)
- Error messages guide users through setup (not just "something's wrong")
- Commands are accurate and tested (no broken cross-references)

Ready for PyPI! ðŸš€

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-10

**Major Release: Manifest-Driven Architecture & UX Polish**

This release represents a complete rewrite of lite-kits with a focus on modularity, extensibility, and professional UX.

### Added

**Core Features:**
- Manifest-driven installer (kits.yaml as single source of truth)
- Modular installer architecture (detector, validator, conflict_checker, installer)
- Content-first kit structure (easy to add new agents/shells/commands)
- Preview-first operations (always show changes before applying)
- Smart auto-detection (agents and shells with explicit override flags)
- Conflict checking before installation

**UX Improvements:**
- File count summaries in previews ("Total files to install: 14")
- `help` command that accepts optional command argument (`lite-kits help add`)
- Perfect terminal spacing (leading/trailing newlines on all commands)
- Useful help description (shows quick start instead of repeating tagline)
- `--force` flag for remove command (skip preview and confirmations)
- Banner works with all commands via `--banner` flag (not just standalone)

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive manifest schema documentation (docs/manifest-schema.md)
- Installer design documents
- Human validation test results

### Changed

**Kit Structure:**
- Consolidated project-kit + git-kit â†’ **dev-kit** (all solo development commands)
- New file layout: `kits/{kit-name}/commands/{command-name}.{agent}.md`
- Removed agent/shell subdirectories in favor of file extensions
- Single manifest defines all kit metadata and file mappings

**Commands:**
- `/orient` - Now in dev-kit (was project-kit)
- `/commit` - Now in dev-kit (was git-kit)
- `/pr` - Now in dev-kit (was git-kit)
- `/review` - Now in dev-kit (was git-kit)
- `/cleanup` - Now in dev-kit (was git-kit)
- `/audit` - Now in dev-kit (was project-kit)
- `/stats` - Now in dev-kit (was project-kit)
- `/sync` - Remains in multiagent-kit

**CLI:**
- Help description changed from tagline to actionable quick start
- Improved preview formatting (cleaner, more professional)
- Better error messages and validation
- Consistent `--force` behavior across add and remove

### Fixed

**Critical Bugs:**
- #1: Preview not showing before installation
- #3: Preview confirmation flow issues
- #4: Empty sections showing in preview
- #6: Wrong kits shown in status command
- #7: Duplicate banner in help output

**Other Fixes:**
- Preview confirmation flow (don't skip when user confirms reinstall)
- Duplicate tagline in help output when using `--banner`
- Banner callback logic cleaned up
- Windows console Unicode handling (graceful fallback)

### Architecture

**New Modular Design:**
- `detector.py` - Auto-detect agents, shells, and project type
- `validator.py` - Validate kit installation and integrity
- `conflict_checker.py` - Check for file conflicts before installation
- `installer.py` - Main orchestrator (manifest-driven, no hardcoded logic)
- `manifest.py` - YAML manifest parser and query interface

**Benefits:**
- Zero hardcoded kit IDs or file paths
- Easy to add new commands (just add file + manifest entry)
- Easy to add new agents/shells (just add file variant)
- Separation of concerns (each module has single responsibility)
- Better error handling and validation

### Removed

- Old monolithic installer with hardcoded kit logic
- Separate project-kit and git-kit (consolidated into dev-kit)
- Agent-specific subdirectories (claude/, github/)
- Duplicate files in root (.github/prompts/, .specify/)
- Installer prototype files (installer_old.py, installer_v2.py)

## Release Notes

### v0.2.0 Highlights

This is the biggest release yet! We've completely rewritten the installer architecture to be:
- **Manifest-driven**: All kit metadata in one place (kits.yaml)
- **Modular**: Clean separation of concerns across 4 focused modules
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new commands, agents, shells, and content types
- **Professional**: Perfect UX with proper spacing, file counts, and help system

The kit consolidation (project + git â†’ dev) makes lite-kits simpler to understand and use, while the content-first structure makes it easier for contributors to add new features.

### Migration from v0.1.x to v0.2.0

If you have v0.1.x installed:

```bash
# Remove old kits
lite-kits remove --all

# Upgrade package
pip install --upgrade lite-kits

# Add new dev-kit (replaces project + git)
lite-kits add
```

The dev-kit includes all commands from the old project-kit and git-kit, so you won't lose any functionality.
